This project is part of the curriculum of The Odin Project. I utilized the HTML and CSS skills I've learned up to this point (particularly FlexBox, which is awesome!). Coding from a design and making it come to life was a really enjoyable/fulfilling experience and is something I look forward to doing again! I hope you like what you see!!!
